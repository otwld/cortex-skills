# Diary

## Overview

Preserve useful work history without replacing authoritative plans, issues, ADRs, or
commits.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the current repository context and existing project memory before changing behavior or guidance.
2. State the concrete responsibility, interface, artifact, or user-visible behavior this skill governs.
3. Apply the skill-specific rules: Determine log type; reference existing artifacts; redact sensitive data; record scope, decisions, validation, blockers, and next steps.
4. Prefer durable artifacts, public seams, and validation evidence over local convenience.
5. Stop when the task needs a decision outside this skill's scope and route to the appropriate governance skill.

## Quality Gates

- Guidance is grounded in current files or explicit user intent.
- Output uses project vocabulary and the recruitment example universe when examples are needed.
- Decisions are recorded in the right artifact instead of hidden in transient chat.
- Validation or acceptance criteria are named when the skill changes behavior or workflow.

## Example

Log that Candidate search refactor passed validation and link the ADR rather than
copying it.

## Hard Stops

- Do not proceed on repo facts that can be inspected but have not been checked.
- Do not broaden scope beyond the triggering signal.
- Do not create placeholder guidance, examples, metadata, or documentation.
- Do not claim completion without evidence that covers this skill's checklist.

## Usage Checklist

- Trigger signal is explicit.
- Relevant existing convention or memory was checked.
- Skill-specific rules were applied.
- Artifacts, docs, metadata, or tests affected by the work were updated together.
- Remaining decisions, risks, or validation gaps are stated.

## Cross-References

- None
